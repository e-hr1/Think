    <h1>Terms of Use for Think AI</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 4, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Think AI mobile application ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App. These Terms affect your legal rights and obligations.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Think AI provides users with an interface to interact with a third-party generative artificial intelligence model (Google's Gemini API). The App allows you to submit text, images, and documents ("Input") to receive AI-generated responses ("Output"). All conversations are stored locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for your Input and for how you use the Output. You agree not to use the App for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will not use the App to generate content that is hateful, harassing, violent, or promotes discrimination against individuals or groups based on race, gender, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age.</li>
        <li>You will not use the App to create or disseminate misinformation, spam, or content for deceptive activities.</li>
        <li>You will not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or discover the source code of the App or the API key used for its operation.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that you own your Input, but by providing it, you grant the necessary rights for the App and the underlying AI service (Google) to process it and generate Output.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>The Output is generated by an AI model and may not always be accurate, complete, or reliable. You should not rely on the Output as a sole source of truth or for professional advice (e.g., legal, medical, or financial advice).</p>
    <p>We are not responsible for the Output generated by the AI. You agree to evaluate and bear all risks associated with the use of any Output.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>We own all rights, titles, and interests in and to the App, including its design, user interface, and branding. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use our trademarks or other brand elements.</p>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may use the Output for any purpose, including commercial purposes, provided that your use complies with these Terms and the terms of the underlying AI service (Google Gemini).</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.</p>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR USE OF THE APP; (B) ANY OUTPUT GENERATED BY THE APP; OR (C) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR APP BY ANY THIRD PARTY.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms within the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
