    <h1>Privacy Policy for Think AI</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 4, 2025</p>
      <p>Thank you for using Think AI ("the App"). Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how it is used and protected, and your rights concerning your data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the minimum information necessary to operate the App. This information is categorized as follows:</p>
      
      <h3>A. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conversation Content:</strong> This includes any text, images, and PDF files you send in your conversations with the AI.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Customization Prompt:</strong> If you use the "Customize AI" feature, the text prompt you provide is saved only on your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Information Accessed for Operation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>API Key:</strong> For the App to function, it connects to our Firebase Realtime Database to retrieve an API Key. This key is required to communicate with the Gemini AI service. This is the sole use of Firebase services in the App.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>Your information is used for the following purposes only:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide Core Functionality:</strong> Your conversation content (text, images, PDFs) is sent to Google's Gemini API to generate AI responses. We do not store this content on our servers; it is processed by Google to provide the service. We encourage you to review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>To Store Conversations Locally:</strong> All your conversations, including messages, images, and files, are stored locally on your device using the Hive database. This ensures your data remains private to you. We do not have access to this local data.</li>
        <li><strong>To Customize Your Experience:</strong> The AI customization prompt you provide is stored locally and sent with your requests to the Gemini API to tailor its behavior according to your instructions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. Data is shared only with third parties essential for the App's operation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google (for Gemini API):</strong> Your conversation inputs are shared with Google to use their generative AI models. Google's use of this data is governed by their privacy policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase (for Key Access):</strong> We connect to Firebase Realtime Database solely to retrieve the operational API key. No personal or usage data is shared with Firebase.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Your Control and Data Rights</h2>
      <p>You have full control over the data stored within the App on your device.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Edit:</strong> You can access, review, and rename your conversations at any time within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual conversations or all conversations at once using the "Delete All Conversations" feature in the app's settings. This action is final and permanently removes the data from your device's local storage.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Your conversation data is stored locally on your device. Communication with the Gemini API is secured using industry-standard encryption (HTTPS). The API key used by the app is retrieved from a secure Firebase database.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.</p>
